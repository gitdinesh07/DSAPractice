Backtracking: name itself suggests that we are going back and coming forward;
    * It uses the Brute force search to solve the problem.
    * the brute force search says that for the given problem, we try to make all the possible solutions
    * and pick out the best solution from all the desired solutions.
    * backtracking is not used in solving optimization problems.
    * Backtracking is used when we have multiple solutions, and we require all those solutions.
