Backtracking -
Backtracking can also be said as an improvement to the brute force approach. So basically,
the idea behind the backtracking technique is that it searches for a solution to a problem among all the available options.
Initially, we start the backtracking from one possible option and if the problem is solved with that selected option
then we return the solution else we backtrack and select another option from the remaining available options.


 *Backtracking name itself suggests that we are going back and coming forward;
    * It uses the Brute force search to solve the problem.
    * the brute force search says that for the given problem, we try to make all the possible solutions
    * and pick out the best solution from all the desired solutions.
    * backtracking is not used in solving optimization problems.
    * Backtracking is used when we have multiple solutions, and we require all those solutions.
